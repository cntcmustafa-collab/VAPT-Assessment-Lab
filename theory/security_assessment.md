## Understanding Security Assessment

Security assessment is the process of identifying weaknesses in systems using structured frameworks such as NIST.

### Types of Security Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment: Identifies known weaknesses using scanners like OpenVAS.
- Penetration Testing: Simulates real-world attacks using Kali Linux tools such as Metasploit and Nmap.
- Compliance Testing: Verifies configurations against standards like CIS Benchmarks.
